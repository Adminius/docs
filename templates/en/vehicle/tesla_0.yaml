  You need to generate an `access` and a `refresh` token for communicating with the Tesla API.

  The following apps allow to create these tokens:
  - [Auth app for Tesla (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auth-app-for-tesla/id1552058613#?platform=iphone)
  - [Tesla Tokens (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.leveugle.teslatokens)
  - [Tesla Auth (macOS, Linux)](https://github.com/adriankumpf/tesla_auth)

  **Note:** This API is [not officially supported](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com) by Tesla and will be deprecated step by step.
